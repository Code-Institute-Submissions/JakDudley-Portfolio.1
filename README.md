My First Portfolio
Here I willshow what I have leanred over the last two modules, HTML and CSS
I hope you enjoy! 

Whilst thinking of my porfolio subject I've decided to use a field im comrfotable with so I decided to make a restaurant of my own.
I had a look at many sucsessful companise to see what the compettion is doing, with doing this i found how i want to style my own website. 

Starting off I made a simple structre with the <header> <nav> and <footer> elements so i knew where i wanted to place items within the page.
After creating and styling the <h1> I needed to find a suitable image to attract and draw the attention of the user, i have linked the image at the bottom of this READ.me.
I came across a issue when it came to placing the image to the centre of the page but after playing around, looking through the notes i took throughout my lessons I realised what i was doing wrong and soon fixed the issue.
With my <nav>, I knew how i wanted it layed out but wasn't 100% sure how to reach my goal path, so i reached out to a friend I made on Slack, who i shall refrence down below, he pushed me and made me remember what i needed to 
do along with the help of W3 Schools.
