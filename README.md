# Castlia 
Castlia is a restaurant that I have plucked out of thin air, to make this restaurant a reality I have created a user-friendly website. As Castlia is a professional place to visit I wanted to create a sleek, smart and professional layout to match the quality.  

I have created an interactive navigation bar placed above the hero image for easy navigation around the site.

## Starting My Project 
Before even thinking about what HTML and CSS I was going to be using I needed to think of a few items:
1. Business type
2. Target Audience
3. Site Aims 
4. Color Scheme 
5. Navigation

### Business Type 
- Restaurant, I chose to go down the restaurant path purely because I've been in the hospitality industry for 7 years myself and chose this giving myself the advantage of content for the site. 
- As I said being in the industry I know what the competition is, I know what the users what and desire on a restaurants site 
- Customers expect, simple but yet elegancy, the better looking and organised website the higher the chance of them getting a better experience at the venue
### Target Audience
- My target audience is quite broad from; families to businesses and groups of friends, the easier the interaction and navigation the longer the user will choose to stay on the site and be more likely to return and book a table and if not to share to their peers. 
- Users that are looking for a new place to dine out who just want to see what information they need ie; booking a table, seeing the menu without having to complete a maze to find and all the needed information to get in touch if need be or even find us on a map. 

### Site Aims 
- When creating my site I wanted users to be aesthetically pleased
- I wanted the customer to not be confused and redirect to another restaurant site
- To offer the user an easy to navigate and accessible experience across what ever device they desire to use 
### Color Scheme 
 - When deciding the color scheme I wanted to make the site look smart and fresh as well as professional, to do this I stuck to two main colors one of which is #e2d6bd as the background and #F5F5F5 as the navbar color along with styles for hover: . 

## Features that are used across the site
To keep the professionalism of the site I kept certain features the same across each page this also makes navigating around easier for the user. 
 **Navbar**
The Navbar appears on all pages, it has interactive links to all pages, home, menu, contact us and review. To make the user understand which page they are currently on I used a class of "active" to change the background color of the active page. To add to the user experience I implemented a :hover function, so when the user hovers over each page the background color is changed. For the media query of (Max-width: 620px;) I removed the :hover function so the hero image text was overlapped with the background color.

  **Hero Image** 
The hero image is shown at the top of each page (below the nav), by continuing to show the hero image across each page it creates a familiar feel for the user and reminds them of which restaurant they're visiting. To further increase the user experience I have placed text within the hero image which is sat on top, the information within this text makes it possible for the user to have all info on one page if needs be. Upon loading into each page the hero image has a zoom effect, to essentially show off the brand of which is Castleia and force them to notice it and its surrounding elements.

**Navbar**
The navbar is placed within the footer elements to keep a consistent flow across all pages, I wanted to keep the nav bar clean and simple so it didnt distract the user from the actual content of the site, with it being a restaurant site i felt like the navbar wasnt all that important but still making it fixed and over each page. By just placing icons for the relevant soical media pages, twitter, instagram, pinterest and facebook i believe i keep the look of the site simple and also smart.
